					<h2>Help: Metadata structures</h2>

					<p>PUMA connects data layers to metadata structures describing what the data represents, how will it be displayed and how is various data related.</p>
					<p>Geographical features in data layers are connected to <b>places</b> (real world locations - cities, countries, regions) and grouped under <b>topics</b>, which in turn are grouped under <b>themes</b>. <i>(Topics are invisible to the end user and only serve to
					simplify the administratorâ€™s work.)</i></p>
					<p>Information about the features is described by <b>attributes</b> in <b>attribute sets</b>, through which it is available both to computations in the analyses module and to visualizations settings in Front Office.</p>
					<p><b>Styles</b> and <b>layer groups</b> determine how the features will be displayed on the map and where will the corresponding layer be available in Front Office, respectively.</p>
					<p><b>Imaging / refence period</b> specifies the timeframe in which the data was collected (for which the data is valid). A defined period allows for comparison among different places.</p>
					<p>All comparable data is grouped under the same <b>scope</b>. Scopes determine <b>analytical units levels</b> (levels of division of geographical areas to be examined) and data standards and nomenclatures.</p>
